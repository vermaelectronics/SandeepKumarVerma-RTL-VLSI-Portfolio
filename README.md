## 💼 Internship Experience
### FPGA Developer Intern – **Bariflo Cybernetics Pvt. Ltd.** *(Jan 2024 – Jun 2024)*
- Designed and implemented a Verilog HDL Water Quality Index module with Mamdani fuzzy-logic on a Cora Z7-10
 SoC board, achieving average accuracy errors of <0.001 % (WQIFS1) and 7.74% (WQIFS2).
- Performed comprehensive RTL verification and system performance optimization in Xilinx Vivado, reducing static/
dynamic power to 0.090W/0.004W (WQIFS1) and 0.089W/0.00389W (WQIFS2).
- Deployed FPGA hardware with efficient resource utilization-111.95% Slice LUTs for WQIFS1 and 51.47% for WQIFS2
 while gaining hands-on experience in end-to-end FPGA-based design and verification.

## 🚀 Key Projects
### [Design & Performance Optimization of IEEE-754 Floating-Point ALU on FPGA](https://github.com/vermaelectronics/Area-and-Resource-optimization-of-32-bit-Floating-Point-ALU)
 - Engineered four IEEE-754 format based ALU configurations (23/19/15/11-bit mantissas) on a Xilinx Artix-7 Nexys 4
 DDR board using Verilog HDL and Vivado 2024.1, allowing seamless precision scaling for diverse applications.
 - Cut FPGA resource usage dramatically, slashing LUT count by 56% (3,016→1,314) and I/O pins by 35% (103→67)
 while retaining >99.9% accuracy in the 23/19/15-bit versions and quantifying acceptable error in the 11-bit variant.
 - Synthesized a flexible datapath architecture with a leading-one detector for rapid normalization, custom rounding logic,
 and a 4-to-1 operation multiplexer-optimizing performance and logic efficiency without specialized timing jargon.

### [Pipelined CORDIC Architecture based DDFS Design and Implementation](https://github.com/vermaelectronics/CORDIC_BASED_DDFS_CODE_SANDEEP)
- Designed a pipelined Direct Digital Frequency Synthesizer using the CORDIC algorithm on a Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC
 board with Verilog HDL and Vivado 2022.2, featuring on-chip VIO/ILA validation.
- Implemented two scalable configurations-16-stage/16-bit LUT (27 µHz–99.72 MHz, 0.093 W, 252 slices, 732 FFs, 878
 LUTs) and 8-stage/8-bit LUT (55 µHz–97.77 MHz, 0.089 W, 153 slices, 184 FFs, 508 LUTs).
- Streamlined the architecture to cut slice usage by 76% and LUT count by 26% versus baseline, while sustaining 99.72
 MHz output at under 0.1 W.
